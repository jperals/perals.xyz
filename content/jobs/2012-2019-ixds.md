In 2012 I joined a small team of talented and innovative folks at the Interaction Design Studios (IXDS) in Berlin.

Under a user-centric process, I spent 7 years developing high fidelity UX prototypes for big and small customers, uncluding Siemens, Bosch, Deutsche Telekom, as well as leading companies in the German automotive industry.

IXDS was acquired by PwC in 2020.
