In 2020 I joined Amazon, where I contributed to the launch of the [AWS Systems Manager Quick Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-quick-setup.html) console.

Since 2022 I am part of the team behind [Cloudscape](https://cloudscape.design), the AWS design system.
