      <description>One of my main tasks at Content Mind was to take care of the visual layer of a Plone-based health information portal.
The most fun part was the development of complex and visually rich web apps such as a quiz game and a nutrition tracking app.</description>

      <description>At IXDS I have the opportunity to contribute to top emerging design projects by helping make UX concepts tangible.
One of the most interesting aspects of my work at IXDS is the close relationship between design and engineering —and one of ist most challenging aspects is the need to work in quick iterations while allowing for mid-term development at the same time.
Indeed, an often overlooked aspect of such discipline is how important good coding patterns are in order for the code base to be flexible for unexpected requirement changes.</description>
